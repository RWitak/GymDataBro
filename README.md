## How to use

**GymDataBro** is your companion in the gym and helps you track various kinds of strength training programs.

It offers _RPE_ ("Rate of Perceived Exertion") as a guideline: A 0-10 scale of how challenging a given set is. For ease of calculation, think of it as reverse count of repetitions "in the tank", where you could do 3 more at RPE-7, 1 more at RPE-9… and not a single rep more at RPE-10, aka "to failure".

Based on your previous reps, weight and RPE on a given exercise, and your maximum weight (your "One Rep Max" = _ORM_), an appropriate weight for each step of your program is calculated - and updates automatically with every set you do.

For this functionality, an internal log is kept in a database. In a future version of this app, you will even be able to see your stats and track your progress!

In this current version, you can only choose between some predefined programs. With future releases, you will be able to put together your own programs by combining the various workouts GymDataBro has to offer - or even create own workouts!
